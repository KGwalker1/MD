## 1. HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND

### The Post-Independence Expansion (1947-1970s)

**Massive Growth**:

- From 3 psychology departments at independence (1947) to **32 departments by end of 1960s**
- UGC (established 1956) provided generous funding for expansion
- ICSSR supported research projects
- International exchange programs (Commonwealth, Fulbright, Ford Foundation) sent scholars to UK, US, Canada for training

**The Problem**:

- Psychology expanded quantitatively but **not qualitatively**
- Research remained imitative of Western models
- "Psychology in India was dominated by scholars trained abroad for the next two decades"
- Focus on "safe" laboratory topics: perception, memory, learning, reaction time

**The Disconnect**:

- Indian psychologists were studying Western problems with Western methods
- Little attention to India's unique social realities: poverty, caste, communalism, illiteracy, population explosion
- "The poverty of social psychology is reflected in its set definitions"

---

## 2. THE CRISIS OF RELEVANCE (MID-1970s)

### The Turning Point

**Growing Disillusionment**:
By the mid-1970s, Indian psychologists began realizing that:

- **60+ years of Western psychology in India had not yielded significant discoveries**
- Research was "dull and replicative"
- Psychology was **socially irrelevant** - not addressing India's pressing problems
- Psychologists were becoming **marginalized in national development** discourse

**The "Left Out" Feeling** :

> "The feeling of 'left out' has sprouted among psychologists a strong urge to make their research efforts relevant to the process of national development"

### The Core Problem: Two Worlds Phenomenon

Indian psychologists lived in **two different worlds**:

- **Professional world**: Western scientific psychology, value-free research, laboratory experiments
- **Personal world**: Indian cultural values, traditional wisdom, concern for social problems

**Manifestations**:

- Psychologists shared socio-cultural context with Indian masses but didn't integrate it professionally
- "Indian psychology has become not only imitative and subservient but also dull and replicative"
- "Replications and imitations have sometimes taken us to ridiculous lengths that we have studied caste like a race, communalism like capitalism and untouchables as American blacks"

---

## 3. KEY CRITICS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS

### A. Ashis Nandy (1974)

**The Seminal Critique**:

> "Indian psychology has become not merely imitative and subservient but also dull and replicative"

**Key Arguments**:

- Psychology of dissent needed - opposition to banality of caste, gender, and class politics
- Indian psychologists were "recipients rather than exchange agents of knowledge"
- Flow of knowledge was one-directional (West to India)
- Research patterned on American studies - a country without India's problems

**Nandy's Diagnosis**:

- "The non-paradigmatic crisis in Indian Psychology"
- Struggle was about "sticking to the paradigm of being a good scientist" rather than addressing real issues
- Psychology was more attuned to "processes of doing science rather than falling into the reflexivity of criticality"

### B. K.G. Agrawal (1973)

**The Term "Adoptology"**:

- Coined to describe Indian psychology as merely adopting Western theories without critical examination
- No original contribution or adaptation to Indian context

### C. Durganand Sinha (1977)

**The Call for Indigenous Psychology**:

> "The goal of indigenization is the development of 'appropriate psychology' and not 'parochial psychology'"

**Key Contributions**:

- Called for psychology with **own paradigms** rooted in Indian soil
- Distinguished between **exogenous indigenization** (adapting Western psychology) and **endogenous indigenization** (developing from Indian traditions)
- Emphasized that Western models must adapt to India's cultural realities
- "One of the architects of modern Indian psychology"

**Sinha's Vision** :

- Psychology must address "problems vital to the country"
- Need for "assimilative synthesis" of indigenous and modern knowledge
- Psychology should be "culturally anchored" with "unique character that fits with the country's socio-cultural ethos"

### D. J.B.P. Sinha (1973)

**Leadership in Social Psychology**:

- Urged scientific understanding of Indian social reality through indigenous knowledge
- Later developed "Nurturant Task Leadership" (1980) - culture-specific organizational theory
- Contributed to organizational psychology relevant to Indian context

### E. Other Critics

- **Mukherjee (1980)**: Emphasized relevance to social reality
- **Pareek (1981)**: Called for commitment to social values and national needs

## 7. THE INDIGENIZATION MOVEMENT EMERGES

### The 1970s as Turning Point

1. **Disenchantment with Western psychology**
   - Inconsistent findings and unconfirmed theories
   - Compelled psychologists to think afresh

2. **Surging nationalism**
   - Trend toward de-colonization of psychological knowledge
   - Searching philosophical roots of Indian wisdom
   - Retrieving indigenous concepts from ancient texts

3. **Confronted by problems of national development**
   - Communal conflicts, poverty, inequality
   - Western psychology did not offer usable solutions
   - Even appropriate perspectives lacking

4. **Formation of IACCP (International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology)**

   - Facilitated alternative thinking

### Definition of Indigenization

**Durganand Sinha (1977, 1986, 1993)**:

> "The process of making the discipline appropriate/suited to the socio-cultural soil of the country"

**Kim (1990)** :
Indigenous psychology is:

- (a) Native

- (d) About understanding how local context affects psychological description, explanation, and application

**Key Elements** :

- Primacy of indigenous/local/culturally derived perspective

- Indigenous culture as source of concepts and theories
- Rather than imposed theories from outside

### Two Types of Indigenization

| Type                          | Description                                          | Approach                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exogenous Indigenization**  | Integration of modern psychology with Indian thought | Start with Western tests/measures, adapt to Indian conditions          |
| **Endogenous Indigenization** | Development from Indian philosophical perspective    | Start with Indian texts and traditions, develop psychological concepts |

   - Communalism and communal violence (Gardner Murphy's UNESCO project)
   - Caste and social stratification
   - Poverty and economic disadvantage
   - National integration and social change
