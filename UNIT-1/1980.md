## 1. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: BUILDING ON THE 1970s

### The Foundation

The 1980s indigenization movement was a **direct continuation and intensification** of the 1970s crisis:

**1970s Developments**:

- Growing disillusionment with Western psychology (Nandy's critique: "dull and replicative")
- Call for indigenous psychology with own paradigms (D. Sinha, 1977)
- Move to addressing social issues (poverty, caste, communalism)
- Recognition that Western theories didn't fit Indian reality

**The Transition**:

> "The signs of efforts to outgrow the alien frame were noticed in the 1970s. The search for a new identity became a major question. Culture-specific concepts, and a search for culturally appropriate methods and tools were emphasized and the relevance of culture was realized."

**1980s Intensification**:

- Indigenization picked up **momentum** in the 1980s
- Integration of indigenous and foreign ideas, concepts, methods
- "Blending scientific ways with indigenous concepts emerged as an important academic agenda"

---

## 2. DEFINITION AND MEANING OF INDIGENIZATION

### Durganand Sinha's Definition

> **"Indigenisation is the process of making the discipline sensitive to cultural nuances and social reality."**

> **"The goal of indigenization is the development of 'appropriate psychology' and not 'parochial psychology'."**

**Key Elements**:

- Making psychology **culturally sensitive**
- Developing **appropriate psychology** for India
- Not rejecting Western psychology entirely, but **adapting** it
- Creating psychology that fits Indian **socio-cultural ethos**

### Kim's Definition (1990)

Indigenous psychology is:

1. **Native** - originating from within the culture
2. **Not transported** from another region
3. **Designed for its people** - relevant to local population
4. **Context-sensitive** - understanding how local context affects psychological description, explanation, and application

### Core Characteristics :

| Feature                               | Description                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primacy of indigenous perspective** | Local/culturally derived viewpoint takes precedence |
| **Relevance to indigenous culture**   | Must be meaningful to local people                  |
| **Indigenous culture as source**      | Concepts and theories derived from local traditions |
| **Not imposed from outside**          | Rejection of wholesale import of foreign theories   |

## 4. TWO ROUTES OF INDIGENIZATION

### Durganand Sinha's Classification

| Route                         | Description                                                             | Approach                                                               | Example                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Endogenous Indigenization** | Purely product of culture; taking native concepts and categories        | Start with Indian texts and traditions, develop psychological concepts | Sankhya-Yoga psychology, Bhakti psychology, concepts from Ayurveda |
| **Exogenous Indigenization**  | Product of interaction of cultural variables with concepts from outside | Start with Western tests/measures, adapt to Indian conditions          | Adapting IQ tests, personality scales for Indian context           |

### The Dominant Route in 1980s: Exogenous

**Why Exogenous was Preferred**:

- Majority of Indian psychologists were **trained in Western models**
- Sudden shift to endogenous theories not feasible
- Natural to continue using Western concepts with **increasing sensitivity to cultural context**

**Adair's Observation (1989)** :

> "Psychology in India is gradually getting indigenised" through exogenous route - local adaptation of imported discipline

### The Endogenous Stream

**Intensification in 1980s-1990s**:

- Efforts to rejuvenate psychology in ancient texts **intensified in the 1980s and 1990s**
- Notable publications by Paranjpe (1984, 1998), Chakraborty (1995), Saraswathi (1999), K. Ramakrishna Rao (2002, 2005)

**Key Publications**:

- Ramachandra Rao: _Development of Psychological Thought in India_ (1962)
- Ragunath Safaya: _Indian Psychology_ (1975)
- Kuppuswami: _Elements of Ancient Indian Psychology_ (1985)
- Paranjpe: _Self and Identity in Modern Psychology and Indian Thought_ (1984)

---

## 8. CRITICAL REFLECTIONS AND DEBATES

### A. Limitations of Cross-Cultural Approach

**Sinha's Critique (1997)** :

- Cross-cultural work led to **testing Western theories on Indian samples**
- Very rarely studies originated from needs of Indian society
- Very rarely tested Indian concepts in other cultures
- **Indiscriminate search for cultural differences** made ventures superficial
- Without providing much understanding of culture or contemporary problems

**Misra and Gergen (1993)** :

- To a large extent cross-cultural psychology remained a **methodological enterprise**
- **Culture remained a peripheral concern**

### B. The Endogenous vs. Exogenous Debate

**Tension**:

- Endogenous: Purely Indian, but may lack scientific rigor
- Exogenous: Scientifically rigorous, but may not be fully Indian

**Resolution Attempted**:

- "Blending scientific ways with indigenous concepts"
- Integration of both approaches

### C. Critique of Indigenization

**Nandy's Perspective**:

- Indigenization sometimes becomes **uncritical worship of the past**
- Need for criticality about Indian culture itself, not just Western psychology
- Sometimes claims of cultural superiority over Western models

**The Conformist vs. Critical Tension** :

- 1980s psychology remained largely **conformist** - sticking to scientific paradigm
- Failed to fully embrace **critical perspectives**
- "Apolitical, neutral and rudimentary" political strategy
- "Lack of effort to raise critical issues, engage in movements"

### D. The "Left Out" Problem

**Continued Marginalization**:

- Even in 1980s, psychology remained on **"backbench"** in national planning
- Other social sciences (economics, sociology, political science) more prominent
- Psychologists wanted to "break free from theoretical and methodological constraints"

---

## 9. IMPACT AND LEGACY

### Immediate Impact (1980s)

**Positive Changes**:

- Psychology became **more culturally sensitive**
- Development of **culture-specific concepts and theories**
- **Integration** of traditional Indian wisdom with modern psychology
- **Methodological innovations** appropriate to Indian context
- **Interdisciplinary collaboration** increased

**Publications Boom**:

- Research publications took "quantum jump"
- Many books on Indian psychology published
- Textbooks incorporating Indian perspectives

### Long-term Legacy (1990s-2000s)

**1990s: Paradigmatic Concerns**:

- Identity crisis: "What is Indian psychology?"
- Disciplinary identity questions
- Continued refinement of indigenous approaches

**2000s-Present: Indian Psychology in Academia** :

- **Handbook of Indian Psychology** (Rao, Paranjpe, Dalal, 2008)
- **Textbooks** on Indian psychology (Kuppuswami, 1985; Misra and Mohanty, 2002)
- Integration in teaching programs (Cornelissen, 2005)

**Current Status** :

> "By the turn of this new millennium, the academic scenario is changing in India. The scientific community is better prepared now than in the past to accept a psychology rooted in native wisdom and philosophical texts."

**Challenges Remaining**:

- "Recipient nature of research endeavours, antiquated and obsolete teaching programmes, and lack of applied orientation have devoid the discipline of any professional momentum"
- Need to "grapple with the real issues of development and to act as social catalysts in the change process"

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR EXAM

### Must-Know Points:

1. **The 1980s was the decade of indigenization** - building on 1970s social issues movement, psychology became culturally sensitive

2. **Durganand Sinha defined indigenization** as "making the discipline sensitive to cultural nuances and social reality"

3. **Two routes**: Endogenous (from Indian traditions) and Exogenous (adapting Western concepts) - exogenous was more common in 1980s

4. **Key indigenous concept**: "Nurturant Task Leadership" (J.B.P. Sinha, 1980) - flagship theory combining Indian nurturance with Western management

5. **Other indigenous concepts**: Extension motivation, dependency proneness, integral intelligence, lajja (shame), bhakti (devotion)

6. **Major areas**: Social cognition, intelligence/ cognition, self and identity, organizational psychology, emotions, health, developmental psychology

7. **Key insight**: Indian self is not simply individualist or collectivist - "coexistence of opposites"

8. **Integration approach**: "Blending scientific ways with indigenous concepts"

9. **Critique of cross-cultural psychology**: Remained methodological enterprise; culture peripheral (Misra and Gergen, 1993)

10. **Key psychologists**: Durganand Sinha, J.B.P. Sinha, Girishwar Misra, Ajit Dalal, Anand Paranjpe, K.R. Rao

11. **Institutional developments**: Centres for Advanced Studies, research institutes, UGC funding

12. **Legacy**: Led to 1990s paradigmatic concerns and 2000s emergence of Indian psychology in academia

13. **Handbook of Indian Psychology** (2008) by Rao, Paranjpe, and Dalal - culmination of indigenization efforts

14. **Current status**: Scientific community better prepared to accept psychology rooted in native wisdom, but challenges remain

15. **The goal**: "Appropriate psychology" not "parochial psychology" - integration, not rejection
