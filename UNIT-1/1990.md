## 1. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: FROM 1980s INDIGENIZATION TO 1990s CRISIS

### The Buildup

**1980s Achievements**:

- Indigenization movement gained momentum
- Development of culture-specific concepts (Nurturant Task Leadership, extension motivation)
- Integration of traditional and modern approaches
- "Blending scientific ways with indigenous concepts"

**The Unresolved Tension**:
Despite 1980s progress, fundamental questions remained unanswered:

- What exactly is "Indian psychology"?
- Is it psychology in India, psychology of India, or Indian psychology?
- Can Western scientific methods capture Indian psychological reality?
- What is the relationship between traditional Indian thought and modern psychology?

**The Crisis Emerges**:

> "The 1990s marked a period of paradigmatic concerns and a pronounced disciplinary identity crisis"

> "The field grappled with several paradigmatic concerns and a pronounced disciplinary identity crisis"

---

## 2. DEFINITION AND NATURE OF THE CRISIS

### What is a Paradigmatic Concern?

**Paradigm** (Kuhn's concept):

- A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality
- Shared by members of a scientific community

**Paradigmatic Concerns in 1990s Indian Psychology**:

1. **Ontological**: What is the nature of psychological reality in India?
2. **Epistemological**: How can we know Indian psychological phenomena?
3. **Methodological**: What methods are appropriate for studying Indian psychology?
4. **Axiological**: What values should guide Indian psychological research?

### The Disciplinary Identity Crisis

**Core Question**: "What is Indian psychology?"

**The Confusion**:
| Interpretation | Meaning | Problem |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Psychology in India** | Western psychology practiced in India | Imitative, not indigenous |
| **Psychology of India** | Study of Indian people using any methods | May still use Western frameworks |
| **Indian Psychology** | Psychology based on Indian philosophical traditions | Is it scientific? |

**The Crisis Manifestation**:

- Indian psychologists were unsure of their disciplinary identity
- Torn between Western scientific psychology and Indian traditional wisdom
- "Psychology in India is mostly a poor imitation of western research and does not lead to understanding Indian social reality"
- "A crisis was perceptible in the discipline"

---

## 3. CORE PARADIGMATIC CONCERNS

### A. The Science vs. Tradition Dilemma

**The Tension**:

- **Western scientific psychology**: Based on logical empiricism, experimentation, quantification
- **Indian traditional psychology**: Based on introspection, meditation, spiritual experience, qualitative understanding

**The Problem**:

> "Psychological theories and constructs were taken as intrinsically biological, materialistic/objective in content, and quantitative in methodological approach"

> "Therefore psychology, like other natural and physical sciences, was thought to be culture-free and psychological processes as distributed/shared uniformly across diverse cultures"

**The 1990s Question**: Can Indian psychology be both scientific and rooted in tradition?

### B. The Universalism vs. Cultural Specificity Debate

**Universalist Position**:

- Psychological processes are universal, same across cultures
- Western theories apply everywhere
- Need for standardization and generalization

**Cultural Specificity Position**:

- Psychological processes are culturally shaped
- Indian psychology must reflect Indian reality
- Western theories don't fit Indian context

**The 1990s Crisis**: Which position to adopt? Can both be true?

### C. The Quantitative vs. Qualitative Methodology Debate

**The Dominant Paradigm (Before 1990s)**:

- Positivist methodology dominant
- Quantitative, experimental, statistical
- "Mapping quantitative variations in psychological variables was the main research strategy"

**The Challenge (1990s)**:

- Qualitative methods gain attention
- "Qualitative research methods are increasingly gaining importance among researchers who want to conduct an in-depth study of phenomena"
- "The qualitative versus quantitative debate has coincided with the rapid development of mixed methods"

**The Crisis**: Is quantitative research appropriate for Indian psychological phenomena? Can qualitative methods be scientific?

### D. The Objectivity vs. Subjectivity Problem

**Western Model**:

- Third-person, objective, detached observation
- "Psychology is predominantly based on Euro-American sources and is concerned with understanding the 'third person'"

**Indian Model**:

- First-person, subjective, introspective
- "Indian psychology focuses on understanding oneself first and, therefore, it is essentially subjective and experiential in nature"
- "The whole approach bases itself on the premise that 'truth should be realized rather than known intellectually'"

**The Crisis**: Can subjective experience be studied scientifically?

---

## 4. THE IDENTITY CRISIS: "WHAT IS INDIAN PSYCHOLOGY?"

### The Three Possible Meanings

| Term                    | Definition                                                        | Status in 1990s                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Psychology in India** | Western psychology as taught and practiced in Indian universities | Dominant but criticized                |
| **Psychology of India** | Study of Indian people, their behavior, mental processes          | Growing but methodologically contested |
| **Indian Psychology**   | Psychology based on Indian philosophical and spiritual traditions | Emerging, debated, not fully accepted  |

### The Debate

**The Conservative View**:

- Indian psychology must follow Western scientific standards
- Traditional Indian concepts are unscientific, philosophical, not psychological
- Risk of "revivalism" and "uncritical worship of the past"

**The Radical Indigenist View**:

- Indian psychology must be based on Indian traditions (Yoga, Vedanta, Buddhism)
- Western psychology is culturally limited, not universal
- Need for "endogenous indigenization"

**The Integrationist View**:

- Both Western and Indian approaches have value
- "Blending scientific ways with indigenous concepts"
- Scientific rigor + cultural relevance

### The Naming Controversy

**Cornelissen's Concern (2014)** :

> "'Indian psychology'... is a name that needs explanation every time it is used... and it continues to court controversy due to its associations with various forms of Indian nationalism. For an approach to science with claims of universality, this is a problematic encumbrance"

**Rao's Defense (2008)** :

> "We prefer to use the name Indian psychology... because this usage is consistent with the universally accepted sense of the analogous subject, Indian philosophy"

**The 1990s Situation**: The term "Indian Psychology" was used but not universally accepted; confusion about its meaning persisted.

---

## 5. EPISTEMOLOGICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL DEBATES

### A. The Positivist vs. Post-Positivist vs. Interpretivist Debate

**Six Paradigms Identified** :

1. **Positivism**: Objective reality, measurable, cause-effect
2. **Post-positivism**: Modified objectivity, critical realism
3. **Critical Perspective**: Power, ideology, social change
4. **Social Constructionism**: Reality socially constructed through language
5. **Existential Phenomenology**: Lived experience, meaning
6. **Co-operative Enquiry**: Participatory, collaborative research

**The 1990s Crisis**: Which paradigm is appropriate for Indian psychology?

### B. The Methodological Crisis

**The Dominant Approach (Critiqued)**:

> "The researchers were dominated by the mindset that psychological characteristics are stable and reliable dispositions subject to quantification"

> "Cognitive processes were handled in terms of concrete and manipulable entities"

> "The positivist methodology was dominant and critical determinant of the choice of problems, variables, processes, and practices"

**The Alternative Approaches (Marginalized)**:

- Indian/spiritual approaches
- Qualitative methods
- Discursive methods
- Phenomenological approaches

**The 1990s Question**: Should these marginalized approaches be given equal status?

### C. The Mixed Methods Debate

**Emergence in 1990s**:

> "The qualitative versus quantitative debate has coincided with the rapid development of mixed methods, which combine qualitative and quantitative methods"

**Johnson and Onwuegbuzie (2004)** :

> "Mixed methods research is formally defined here as the class of research where the researcher mixes or combines quantitative and qualitative research techniques, methods, approaches, concepts or language into a single study"

**The 1990s Promise**: Mixed methods as resolution to the quantitative-qualitative divide?

### D. The Scientific Method Debate

**The Core Question**: What constitutes scientific method in psychology?

**Sedlmeier's Analysis** :

- Qualitative and quantitative methods co-existed all along
- The distinction is "to a certain extent artificial"
- "Subjective experiences still play an important role even in mainstream psychology"
- "Quantification is rather the end product of a data analysis that might begin qualitatively"

**The 1990s Indian Context**: Can Indian psychology develop its own scientific methodology that includes introspection, meditation, and other traditional practices?

---

## 6. KEY CRITICS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS

### A. Girishwar Misra and Kenneth Gergen (1993)

**Contribution**: Critical reflections on limitations of natural science-based approaches

**Key Argument**: Psychology's natural science model is inadequate for understanding human experience

**Impact**: Opened space for alternative epistemologies in Indian psychology

### B. Ashis Nandy (2004)

**Continued Critique from 1970s**:

- Psychology remains imitative and subservient
- "The basic problem involved dependence on conceptual frameworks which are not intrinsic to the experience of society"

**1990s Contribution**: Critique of psychology's political neutrality and conformity

### C. Anand C. Paranjpe

**Contribution**: _Self and Identity in Modern Psychology and Indian Thought_ (1984, 1998)

**1990s Role**: Developing Indian psychology based on interpretation of traditional concepts

**Key Work**: Bridging modern psychology and Indian philosophy

### D. K. Ramakrishna Rao

**Contribution**: _Development of Psychological Thought in India_ (1962, 2011)

**1990s Role**: Systematic presentation of Indian psychological thought

**Key Argument**: Indian psychology has legitimate scientific status

### E. Ajit K. Dalal

**Contribution**: Survey of doctoral research in psychology

**1990s Role**: Documenting the state of the discipline, identifying gaps

### F. Durganand Sinha (Continued Influence)

**Earlier Contributions**: Defined indigenization (1977, 1980s)

**1990s Role**: Continued advocacy for appropriate psychology

**Key Publications**:

- "Indigenisation of psychology in India and its relevance" (1993)
- "Indigenising psychology" (1997)

---

## 7. THE CONTINUED "TWO WORLDS" PROBLEM

### The Persistent Split

**The Problem**:

> "A vast majority of Indian psychologists have shied away from Indian psychological perspectives"

> "Psychologists share the socio-cultural context with the Indian masses, but do not integrate it with their professional identity"

**The 1990s Manifestation**:

- Professional identity: Western scientific psychologist
- Personal identity: Indian cultural being
- The split creates "lack of creativity, originality, and burn out"

### Paranjpe's Analysis

**The Split Personality**:

- Psychologist as professional vs. psychologist as person
- Contributes to "lack of effort to raise critical issues, engage in movements"
- "Apolitical, neutral and rudimentary" political strategy

### The Conformity Problem

**Nandy's Critique**:

- 1990s psychology remained largely **conformist**
- "Sticking to the paradigm of being a good scientist"
- Failed to fully embrace critical perspectives
- "Lack of effort to raise critical issues, engage in movements"

---

## 8. INSTITUTIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL CHALLENGES

### A. Marginalization in National Planning

**The Problem**:

- Psychology remained on the **"backbench"** in national planning
- Other social sciences (economics, sociology, political science) more prominent
- "Feeling of 'left out' has sprouted among psychologists"

**The 1990s Situation**:

- Despite indigenization efforts, psychology not central to policy
- "Psychologists wanted to break free from theoretical and methodological constraints"

### B. Research Institute vs. University Divide

**The Shift (Continued from 1980s)**:

- Psychologists preferred research institutes over universities
- Better environment for innovative research
- But created gap between teaching and research

### C. International Collaboration Tensions

**Cross-Cultural Psychology Critique**:

> "Cross-cultural work led to testing Western theories on Indian samples"

> "Very rarely studies originated from needs of Indian society"

> "Very rarely tested Indian concepts in other cultures"

**The 1990s Question**: Should Indian psychologists continue cross-cultural collaboration or focus on indigenous development?

---

## 9. RESPONSES AND ATTEMPTED RESOLUTIONS

### A. The Indian Psychology Movement (Late 1990s-Early 2000s)

**The Manifesto (2002)**:

- Led by K. Ramakrishna Rao, Girishwar Misra, and others
- More than 150 psychologists gathered in Pondicherry
- Issued "Manifesto on Indian Psychology"

**The Definition**:

> "Indian psychology refers to an emerging scholarly and scientific subfield of psychology. Psychologists working in this field are retrieving the psychological ideas embedded in indigenous Indian religious and spiritual traditions and philosophies, and expressing these ideas in psychological terms that permit further psychological research and application"

**Key Distinction**:

> "'Indian psychology' in this sense does not mean 'the psychology of the Indian people', or 'psychology as taught at Indian universities'"

### B. Handbook of Indian Psychology (2008)

**Editors**: K. Ramakrishna Rao, Anand C. Paranjpe, Ajit K. Dalal

**Significance**: First comprehensive handbook establishing Indian psychology as legitimate field

**Content**: Indian theories of self, consciousness, cognition, emotion, health, etc.

### C. Textbook Developments

**Key Publications**:

- Kuppuswamy: _Elements of Ancient Indian Psychology_ (1985, developed 1990s)
- Cornelissen, Misra, and Varma (2014): Textbook on Indian psychology
- Integration in teaching programs (Cornelissen, 2005)

### D. Methodological Pluralism

**The Resolution Attempt**:

- Acceptance of both quantitative and qualitative methods
- Mixed methods as bridging approach
- "Qualitative methods are also regularly taught in universities"

**The Scientific Method Debate Resolution**:

> "Whether these methods will thrive more in the future depends on whether they show some advantage in the examination of specific questions or hypotheses. The hypotheses derived from Indian psychology may be a case in point"

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR EXAM

### Must-Know Points:

1. **The 1990s was a period of paradigmatic concerns and disciplinary identity crisis** - fundamental questions about the nature and identity of Indian psychology

2. **Core question**: "What is Indian psychology?" - Psychology in India, psychology of India, or Indian psychology based on traditions?

3. **Paradigmatic concerns**: Ontological (nature of reality), epistemological (nature of knowledge), methodological (appropriate methods), axiological (values)

4. **The "Two Worlds" problem continued**: Professional Western identity vs. personal Indian identity, leading to split personality and lack of creativity

5. **Methodological crisis**: Challenge to positivist, quantitative dominance; rise of qualitative methods debate; emergence of mixed methods

6. **Science vs. Tradition debate**: Can Indian psychology be both scientifically rigorous and rooted in Indian philosophical traditions?

7. **Key critics**: Misra & Gergen (1993) - critique of natural science model; Nandy (2004) - critique of conformity; Paranjpe and Rao - development of Indian psychology

8. **Responses**: Indian Psychology Movement (late 1990s), Manifesto on Indian Psychology (2002), Handbook of Indian Psychology (2008)

9. **Definition clarified**: Indian psychology is "based on ideas and practices that developed over thousands of years within the Indian sub-continent" - not just psychology of Indian people or psychology taught in India

10. **Outcome**: Methodological pluralism accepted; Indian psychology gains legitimacy; but tensions between Western and Indian approaches continue

11. **The crisis was not fully resolved** - led to 2000s emergence of Indian psychology in academia as ongoing project

12. **Continued marginalization**: Psychology remained on "backbench" of national planning despite indigenization efforts

13. **Conformity problem**: Psychology remained "conformist" rather than critical; "apolitical, neutral and rudimentary" political strategy

14. **The 1990s laid groundwork for 2000s**: "By the turn of this new millennium, the scientific community is better prepared... to accept a psychology rooted in native wisdom"

15. **Key insight**: The crisis was necessary for maturation - forced clarification of identity, methods, and goals of Indian psychology
