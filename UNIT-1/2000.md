**The Name Issue**:

- Term "Indian psychology" controversial
- Associated with nationalism
- Needs constant explanation

### Scientific Status Debate

**Ongoing Questions**:

- Can subjective methods be truly scientific?
- How to validate introspective reports?
- Generalizability of findings from yoga/meditation studies

### Institutional Challenges

**Limited Integration**:

- Not all universities teach Indian psychology
- Mainstream psychology still dominant
- Limited funding for Indian psychology research
