```

### A. Karma Yoga (The Path of Action)

**Definition**: Selfless action performed without attachment to results

**Core Teaching** (2.47):

> "You have the right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction."

**Psychological Principles**:

| Concept              | Psychological Application         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Nishkama Karma**   | Action without desire for results |
| **Duty Orientation** | Focus on process, not outcome     |
| **Detachment**       | Emotional distance from results   |
| **Present Moment**   | Focus on current action           |

**Mental Health Benefits**:

- **Reduces anxiety**: By focusing on present action rather than future outcomes
- **Breaks rumination**: Active engagement prevents repetitive negative thinking
- **Builds resilience**: Teaches coping through action rather than avoidance
- **Enhances self-efficacy**: Sense of control through action

**Practical Application**:

- "Perform your duty" - occupational therapy principle
- "Without attachment to results" - reducing performance anxiety
- "Neither success nor failure affects the wise" - equanimity training

### B. Bhakti Yoga (The Path of Devotion)

**Definition**: The path of love and devotion to the Divine

**Core Teaching** (9.34):

> "Always think of Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and offer obeisance to Me. Having dedicated your mind and body to Me, you will certainly come to Me."

**Psychological Principles**:

| Concept                  | Psychological Application                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Divine Love**          | Transference of attachment to higher object |

| **Grace**                | Receiving help beyond personal effort       |

**Mental Health Benefits**:

- **Reduces overthinking**: Mind absorbed in devotion cannot simultaneously worry
- **Provides meaning**: Connection to something greater than self
- **Emotional support**: Feeling of being cared for by Divine
- **Self-transcendence**: Moving beyond ego concerns

**Therapeutic Application**:

- Devotion as object relations therapy
- Prayer as coping mechanism
- Surrender as acceptance in ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)

### C. Jnana Yoga (The Path of Knowledge)

**Definition**: The path of wisdom, discrimination, and self-inquiry

**Core Teaching**:

> "The wise see the same Self in all beings" (5.18)

**Psychological Principles**:

## 6. CONCEPT OF THE SELF (ATMAN)

### The Five Koshas (Sheaths) :

The Gita (following Vedantic tradition) describes the self as consisting of five layers:

| Kosha           | Layer         | Nature               |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| **Annamaya**    | Food/Physical | Gross body           |
| **Pranamaya**   | Energy/Vital  | Life force           |
| **Manomaya**    | Mental        | Mind, emotions       |
| **Vijnanamaya** | Wisdom        | Intellect, intuition |
| **Anandamaya**  | Bliss         | Causal body, joy     |

**The True Self (Atman)**:

- Beyond all five koshas
- Eternal, unchanging, pure consciousness
- Identical with Brahman (Universal Self)
- "The Self is neither born nor does it die" (2.20)

### Psychological Implications:

- **Identity beyond roles**: Not limited to job, relationships, body
- **Immortality**: Freedom from death anxiety
- **Transcendence**: Moving beyond ego limitations
- **Unity**: Connection with all beings

## 7. STHITAPRAJNA (EMOTIONALLY STABLE PERSON)

### Definition :

**Sthitaprajna** (Sanskrit: स्थितप्रज्ञ) - "One whose wisdom is firmly established" or "Steady in wisdom" - refers to a person of perfect equanimity and emotional stability.

### Characteristics (Chapter 2, Verses 54-72):

| Verse | Characteristic                                   | Psychological Parallel |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 2.56  | Undisturbed in suffering, unattached in pleasure | Emotional regulation   |
| 2.57  | Free from attachment, fear, and anger            | Secure attachment      |
| 2.58  | Senses withdrawn like tortoise limbs             | Self-control           |
| 2.61  | Controlled mind, focused on Self                 | Mindfulness            |
| 2.64  | Free from attraction and aversion                | Equanimity             |

### Comparison with Emotional Intelligence :

Gayathri and Meenakshi (2013) compared Sthitaprajna with Mayer and Salovey's Emotional Intelligence model:

| Mayer-Salovey EI         | Gita's Sthitaprajna                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Emotional perception     | Awareness of emotional states              |
| Emotional assimilation   | Integration of experience                  |
| Emotional understanding  | Wisdom about impermanence                  |
| **Emotional management** | **Equanimity regardless of circumstances** |

**Key Difference**: While EI focuses on managing emotions, Sthitaprajna transcends emotional reactivity through wisdom.

### The Stages to Sthitaprajna:

1. **Shraddha** (Faith): Initial trust in the path
2. **Sadhana** (Practice): Regular spiritual discipline
3. **Viveka** (Discrimination): Distinguishing real from unreal
4. **Vairagya** (Dispassion): Non-attachment to results
5. **Sthitaprajna** (Steady wisdom): Established equanimity

- **Application**: Finding meaning in work through service orientation

**4. The Example of the Lotus Leaf** (5.10):

- **Modern parallel**: Healthy boundaries
- **Application**: Being in the world but not of it

### Therapeutic Applications:

| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Identify with Atman (true self)       | Identify with core self            |
| Discard identification with body-mind | Challenge negative self-concepts   |
| "I am not the doer"                   | Decentering from thoughts          |
| "I am the witness"                    | Observer stance in mindfulness     |
| Knowledge removes ignorance           | Insight removes distorted thinking |

## 11. RAJA YOGA (PSYCHOLOGY OF MEDITATION)

### The Mind-Control Problem :

**Arjuna's Question** (6.33-34):

| Rumination         | Karma Yoga - present action | Redirects attention     |

## 13. COMPARISON WITH WESTERN PSYCHOLOGY

### A. Psychoanalytic Comparison :

| Freudian Concept   | Gita Concept       | Similarity              |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Id                 | Tamas/Rajas        | Primitive drives        |

| Superego           | Sattva/Dharma      | Moral conscience        |
| Defense mechanisms | Yoga practices     | Managing conflicts      |
| Unconscious        | Subconscious mind  | Hidden mental processes |

**Key Difference**: Freud focuses on managing conflicts; Gita aims at transcending them through self-realization.

### B. Humanistic Psychology Comparison:

| Hierarchy of needs | Four purusharthas             | Life goals framework         |
| Being-cognition    | Sattvic knowledge             | Direct perception of reality |

**Key Difference**: Maslow's self-actualization is within ego; Gita's self-realization is beyond ego.

### C. Cognitive-Behavioral Comparison:

| CBT Concept             | Gita Concept            | Application              |

| Meaninglessness        | Dharma provides purpose               |
| Freedom/responsibility | Karma Yoga - responsible action       |
| Isolation              | Unity of all beings (5.18)            |
| Existential guilt      | Sin is not in action but in intention |

### E. Positive Psychology Comparison:

| Positive Psychology | Gita Equivalent              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Character strengths | Divine qualities (16.1-3)    |
| Flow                | Karma Yoga - absorbed action |
| Resilience          | Sthitaprajna - steady wisdom |
| Meaning             | Dharma - life purpose        |

## CHAPTER 1: ARJUNA VISHADA YOGA

### The Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection

### Setting the Scene :

- **Context**: The battle of Kurukshetra is about to begin
- **Arjuna's Position**: Greatest warrior of his time, skilled archer, righteous prince
- **The Crisis**: Seeing his own relatives, teachers, and loved ones in the opposing army

### Arjuna's Psychological Crisis (Verses 1.28-1.47):

**Physical Symptoms** :

- "My limbs are giving way" (1.30) - Psychomotor weakness
- "My mouth is drying up" (1.28) - Autonomic stress response
- "My body is trembling" (1.29) - Somatic anxiety
- "Hair standing on end" (1.29) - Piloerection (fight-flight)
- "Gandiva (bow) slipping from hand" (1.30) - Motor control loss

**Cognitive Symptoms**:

- "Mind is reeling" (1.30) - Cognitive confusion
- "I see adverse omens" (1.31) - Negative cognitive bias
- "I do not desire victory" (1.31) - Anhedonia
- "What use is kingdom?" (1.32) - Existential questioning

**Emotional/Behavioral Symptoms**:

- Overwhelming grief and compassion (1.28)
- Desire to renounce everything (1.32-1.35)
- Refusal to fight (1.46)
- Seeking guidance from Krishna (1.47)

### Psychological Analysis:

**Modern Diagnosis**: Acute stress reaction, moral injury, existential crisis

**Therapeutic Significance**:

- Demonstrates that even great warriors experience psychological breakdown
- Shows psychosomatic nature of stress (physical symptoms from mental conflict)
- Illustrates the "help-seeking" behavior - turning to a guide/therapist
- Sets up the entire Gita as a therapeutic intervention

**Krishna's Initial Response** (Chapter 2 begins):

- Not immediate comfort, but challenge to weakness
- "This weakness does not befit you" (2.3)
- Direct confrontation of avoidance behavior

---

## CHAPTER 2: SANKHYA YOGA

### The Yoga of Knowledge/Philosophy

### Overview :

This chapter provides the philosophical foundation for all subsequent teachings. It explains:

- The nature of the Self (Atman)
- The distinction between body and soul
- The importance of duty (dharma)
- The path to equanimity

### Key Psychological Concepts (Excluding Already Covered Material):

#### A. The Immortal Soul (Verses 2.11-2.30):

**Core Teaching**: The Self (Atman) is eternal, indestructible, unborn, undying

**Psychological Implications**:

- **Death anxiety reduction**: "The soul neither kills nor can be killed" (2.19-2.21)
- **Identity beyond body**: "The soul is neither born nor does it die" (2.20)
- **Transience of physical form**: Body changes but Self remains constant

**Therapeutic Application**:

- Helps in grief and bereavement counseling
- Reduces fear of mortality
- Builds existential resilience

#### B. The Concept of Swadharma (Verses 2.31-2.37):

**Definition**: One's own duty/righteous path

**Psychological Significance**:

- **Authenticity**: Better to do one's own duty imperfectly than another's perfectly (2.47, 18.47)
- **Purpose and meaning**: Duty provides life direction
- **Self-actualization**: Fulfilling one's nature leads to growth

**Modern Parallel**: Maslow's self-actualization, Rogers' authentic living

#### C. The Equanimous Person (Verses 2.38-2.53):

**Characteristics**:

- "Established in yoga, perform actions" (2.48)
- "Equal in success and failure" (2.38)
- "Not elated by pleasure or disturbed by pain" (2.56)
- "Withdrawn from sense objects" (2.58)

**Psychological State**: Balance, homeostasis, emotional regulation

#### D. The Process of Sense Control (Verses 2.54-2.72):

**The Turtle Analogy** (2.58):

> "When he completely withdraws his senses from sense objects, as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into its shell"

**Psychological Mechanism**:

- Sensory withdrawal (pratyahara)
- Internal vs. external attention
- Self-regulation model

**The Stages to Wisdom**:

1. **Shraddha** (Faith) - Initial trust
2. **Sadhana** (Practice) - Regular discipline
3. **Viveka** (Discrimination) - Wisdom to distinguish real/unreal
4. **Vairagya** (Dispassion) - Non-attachment
5. **Sthitaprajna** (Steady wisdom) - Established equanimity (already covered)

---

## CHAPTER 3: KARMA YOGA

### The Yoga of Action

**Note**: Detailed coverage already provided in main notes. Brief summary:

**Core Teaching** :

- "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action" (3.35)
- Action is inevitable; no one can remain without action even for a moment
- Selfless action (nishkama karma) purifies the mind
- King Janaka as example - action without attachment

**Psychological Focus**: Behavioral activation, process-oriented living, reducing outcome anxiety

---

## CHAPTER 4: JNANA KARMA SANYASA YOGA

### The Yoga of Knowledge, Action and Renunciation

### Key Themes :

#### A. The Divine Lineage of Knowledge (Verses 4.1-4.3):

**The Parampara (Disciplic Succession)**:

- Krishna → Vivasvan (Sun God) → Manu → Ikshvaku → Royal sages
- Knowledge passed down through generations
- Eventually lost, now being revived

**Psychological Significance**:

- **Mentorship model**: Knowledge transmission requires teacher-student relationship
- **Continuity**: Connection to tradition provides stability
- **Authority**: Learning from realized beings vs. mere intellectual study

#### B. The Concept of Avatar (Divine Incarnation) (Verses 4.5-4.8):

**Krishna's Declaration**:

> "Whenever there is a decline in righteousness and an increase in unrighteousness, I manifest Myself" (4.7)

**Psychological Interpretation**:

- **Archetypal emergence**: Divine help appears when needed
- **Hope in crisis**: Restoration of dharma is always possible
- **Cyclical nature**: Understanding ups and downs of life

#### C. Action in Inaction (Verses 4.16-4.18):

**The Paradox**:

> "He who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is wise among men" (4.18)

**Psychological Meaning**:

- **Non-doership**: Action without egoic ownership
- **Flow state**: Activity without sense of personal doer
- **Detached engagement**: Full involvement without attachment

**Example - King Janaka** :
