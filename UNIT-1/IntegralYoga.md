## 1. INTRODUCTION TO INTEGRAL YOGA

### Definition and Nature

**Integral Yoga** (Purna Yoga) is a comprehensive spiritual path developed by Sri Aurobindo that aims at the transformation of the entire being—physical, vital, mental, and spiritual—through the integration of all aspects of human nature with the Divine .

### Key Features:

- **Holistic Approach**: Integrates body, mind, life, and spirit
- **Evolutionary**: Views human consciousness as constantly evolving toward higher states
- **Transformative**: Not just liberation but transformation of nature
- **Practical**: "Yoga is nothing but practical psychology" - Sri Aurobindo
- **Collective**: Progress benefits all humanity, not just the individual
- **Scientific**: Based on rational principles and systematic observation

### Core Psychological Concerns:

1. Understanding the multi-dimensional nature of human consciousness
2. The evolution of consciousness from matter to spirit
3. Transformation of the lower nature (ego) into divine nature
4. Integration of all levels of being
5. Development of the psychic being (evolving soul)
6. Realization of the Supramental consciousness

### Distinctive Features:

Unlike traditional yoga which seeks liberation (moksha) through ascent to transcendent realms, Integral Yoga seeks **transformation of life on earth** through the descent of higher consciousness into the physical world .

## 3. CORE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS

### A. Involution and Evolution

**Involution**: The process by which the Supreme Consciousness concealed itself to create matter

- Consciousness descended through graded planes of increasing density
- From pure Spirit → Supermind → Mind → Life → Matter
- Each plane represents greater "veiling" of consciousness
- Purpose: To create the density needed for physical manifestation

**Evolution**: The gradual unveiling and revelation of consciousness in matter

- Matter → Life → Mind → Supermind → Spirit
- Each stage represents greater revelation of divine consciousness
- Not reverse of involution; matter itself transforms
- Ultimate goal: Divine life on earth

```
INVOLUTION (Descent)          EVOLUTION (Ascent)
     ↓                              ↑
   Spirit                        Spirit
     ↓                              ↑
  Supermind                     Supermind
     ↓                              ↑
    Mind                          Mind
     ↓                              ↑
    Life                          Life
     ↓                              ↑
   Matter    ←———————→           Matter
```

### B. The Two Movements

**Ascent**: The upward movement of consciousness from physical to spiritual

- Individual seeks higher states
- Traditional yoga approach
- Liberation from world

**Descent**: The bringing down of higher consciousness into lower nature

- Divine force enters the being
- Unique to Integral Yoga
- Transformation of world

**Integral Approach**: Both movements combined - ascent for liberation, descent for transformation.

### C. Consciousness as Fundamental

Sri Aurobindo's radical assertion: **Consciousness is the fundamental fact of existence**

- Consciousness is not a byproduct of matter
- Matter is consciousness in a state of "exclusive concentration"
- All evolution is evolution of consciousness
- Even atoms have "will" and "aspiration" (secret will in nature)

### D. The Three Modes of Consciousness

1. **Supreme Divine Self-Knowledge**: Embraces unity and multiplicity
2. **Complete Nescience (Ignorance)**: Dynamic, creative principle of self-limitation
3. **Ignorance (Avidya)**: Intermediate state with power of transformation

---

## 4. THE SEVENFOLD CHORD OF BEING

Sri Aurobindo describes the human being as consisting of seven interconnected planes or levels of consciousness :

### The Seven Planes:

| Plane             | Sanskrit            | Nature                  | Function                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **1. Sat**        | Existence           | Pure being              | Foundation of all existence |
| **2. Chit-Tapas** | Consciousness-Force | Consciousness as energy | Dynamic power of awareness  |
| **3. Ananda**     | Bliss               | Delight/joy             | Essential nature of spirit  |
| **4. Supermind**  | Vijnana/Mahat       | Truth-consciousness     | Direct knowledge            |
| **5. Mind**       | Manas/Buddhi        | Thought/intellect       | Discursive knowledge        |
| **6. Life**       | Prana               | Vital force             | Energy, desire, action      |
| **7. Matter**     | Anna/Prithvi        | Physical substance      | Form, density, inertia      |

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Upper Hemisphere (Divine/Spiritual)

**Sat-Chit-Ananda**: The Divine Trinity

- **Sat**: Pure existence, being, truth
- **Chit**: Pure consciousness, awareness, knowledge
- **Ananda**: Pure bliss, delight, joy

**Supermind (Vijnana)**:

- Truth-consciousness
- Direct, integral knowledge
- Bridge between divine and human
- Knowledge by identity

#### Lower Hemisphere (Human/Manifest)

**Mind**:

- Divided, analytical consciousness
- Reason, intellect, imagination
- Source of both knowledge and ignorance

**Life (Vital)**:

- Vital force, energy, desire
- Emotions, passions, dynamism
- Link between mind and body

**Matter (Physical)**:

- Densest form of consciousness
- Body, form, inertia
- Complete "exclusive concentration"

### The Psychic Being's Position :

The Psychic Being sits **"behind the heart"** - the connecting link between the lower and higher hemispheres, between the evolving surface nature and the eternal Self.

## 5. THE FIVE SHEATHS (PANCHA KOSHA)

The Pancha Kosha model, derived from the Taittiriya Upanishad, forms the practical framework for Integral Yoga psychology :

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         ANANDAMAYA KOSHA              │
│         (Bliss Sheath)                │
│         Causal Body - Soul            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         VIJNANAMAYA KOSHA             │
│         (Wisdom/Intellectual Sheath)  │
│         Higher Mind - Intuition       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         MANOMAYA KOSHA                │
│         (Mental Sheath)               │
│         Mind - Emotions - Thoughts    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         PRANAMAYA KOSHA               │
│         (Vital/Energy Sheath)         │
│         Life Force - Prana            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         ANNAMAYA KOSHA                │
│         (Food/Physical Sheath)        │
│         Gross Body - Matter           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Detailed Analysis of Each Kosha:

#### 1. Annamaya Kosha (Physical Sheath)

**Definition**: The outermost, densest layer - the physical body sustained by food (anna)

**Characteristics**:

- Made of five elements (earth dominant)
- Lowest vibration of self
- Includes bones, muscles, organs, tissues
- Sustained by food and nutrition

**Psychological Significance**:

- Identification with body causes suffering ("I am fat/thin")
- Transformation begins with awareness: "my body" vs. "I am the body"
- Physical practices (asana, proper diet) purify this sheath

**Health Implications**: Imbalances here manifest as physical disease

#### 2. Pranamaya Kosha (Vital/Energy Sheath)

**Definition**: The energy body composed of prana (life force)

**Components**:

- **Five Pranas**:
  - Prana: Inward moving energy (respiration, intake)
  - Apana: Outward moving energy (elimination)
  - Samana: Balancing energy (digestion, assimilation)
  - Udana: Upward energy (speech, growth)
  - Vyana: Diffusive energy (circulation, nerve currents)

**Functions**:

- Physiological processes (breathing, circulation, digestion)
- Protection and guidance
- Link between body and mind
- Carrier of vitality and dynamism

**Psychological Significance**:

- Prana flows through nadis (energy channels)
- Blockages cause disease and disorder
- Pranayama (breath control) regulates this sheath
- Vital being (desires, emotions) operates here

#### 3. Manomaya Kosha (Mental Sheath)

**Definition**: The mental layer - seat of thoughts, feelings, and emotions

**Characteristics**:

- Functions through sensory organs
- Experiences likes/dislikes, pleasure/pain
- Operates on three levels:
  - Conscious mind
  - Subconscious mind
  - Unconscious mind

**Psychological Significance**:

- Source of mental suffering and happiness
- Requires pratyahara (withdrawal of senses) to transcend
- Transmits information between body and external world
- Controls activities of prana and physical body

**Transformation**: Mental discipline, concentration, mindfulness

#### 4. Vijnanamaya Kosha (Wisdom/Intellectual Sheath)

**Definition**: The layer of higher knowledge, wisdom, and intuition

**Characteristics**:

- Beyond ordinary mind's discrimination
- Direct knowing without reasoning
- Bridge between individual and universal mind
- Intuitive place of knowing

**Psychological Significance**:

- Awareness of higher mind
- Connection to universal consciousness
- Active during deep meditation
- Creates link between conscious mind and universal mind

**Functions**:

- Discrimination (viveka)
- Wisdom (vijnana)
- Direct perception of truth

#### 5. Anandamaya Kosha (Bliss Sheath)

**Definition**: The innermost sheath - the causal body of pure joy

**Characteristics**:

- Connected to superconscious/unconscious mind
- Sense of oneness with all
- Beyond "I-ness" and ego
- State of peace, joy, love
- Highest vibration

**Psychological Significance**:

- Closest to the Atman (true Self)
- Experience of Mukti (liberation)
- Samadhi (absorption) occurs here
- Very few reach this state; requires decades of practice

**Note**: Unlike Vedantic view where this is the outermost covering of Atman, Sri Aurobindo sees the **Psychic Being** as deeper still - the evolving soul behind all koshas.

### Interconnection of Koshas :

- The sheaths are **interconnected and interactive**
- What happens on one level affects all others
- Imbalances start at Manomaya Kosha and amplify
- Health requires harmony between all five sheaths
- WHO definition of health aligns with this holistic view

---

## 6. THE STRUCTURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

### The Outer Nature vs. Central Being

Sri Aurobindo distinguishes between:

**Outer Nature (Surface Being)**:

- Physical, vital, mental sheaths
- Ego-centered
- Subject to ignorance and division
- Temporary formations

**Central Being (True Self)**:

- Psychic Being (evolving soul)
- Spiritual Self (Jivatman/Atman)
- Eternal, immutable
- Source of true individuality

### The Ego vs. True Self

**The Ego**:

- Temporary formation within outer nature
- Mental, vital, physical construction
- "I" or "little ego"
- Creates sense of separation
- Utility: Centralizes and individualizes outer consciousness
- Must disappear when true being is discovered

**The True Self**:

- **Jivatman**: Individual self above manifestation; presides over nature
- **Psychic Being**: Evolving soul within manifestation; delegate of the Self
- **Atman**: Universal Self; transcendent and immutable

### Levels of Mind

Sri Aurobindo describes ascending levels of mental consciousness:

| Level              | Characteristic         | Knowledge Type                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Ordinary Mind**  | Thought-based, divided | Indirect, through representation |
| **Higher Mind**    | Silence, less thought  | Knowing without thought          |
| **Illumined Mind** | Light, vision          | Seeing reality directly          |
| **Intuitive Mind** | Intuition from outside | Knowledge given from above       |
| **Supermind**      | Identity, integration  | Knowledge by identity            |

**The Ascent Process** :

1. From mind to Higher Mind (silence)
2. To Illumined Mind (vision/light)
3. To Intuitive Mind (intuition)
4. To Supermind (knowledge by identity)

---

## 7. THE PSYCHIC BEING (SOUL)

### Definition and Nature

**The Psychic Being** (Antaratman, Chaitya Purusha) is the **evolving soul** - the individual spark of the Divine that develops through lifetimes.

**Distinctions**:

- **Soul**: Divine center; eternal, immutable; identical with Origin
- **Psychic Being**: Formed around the soul; evolutionary; grows from life to life

### Characteristics:

| Aspect         | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Nature**     | Divine essence in evolution              |
| **Location**   | Deep within, behind the heart            |
| **Function**   | Mediator between Divine and outer nature |
| **Quality**    | Love, devotion, aspiration, surrender    |
| **Growth**     | Develops from small entity to full being |
| **Continuity** | Survives death; reincarnates             |

### The Psychic Entity vs. Psychic Being :

**Psychic Entity**:

- Present in all humans
- Small, point-like
- Hardly noticed initially
- Latent potential

**Psychic Being**:

- Developed through effort and evolution
- Full-fledged presence
- Can be felt as "psychic presence"
- Guides and transforms the nature

### Role in Transformation :

1. **First Instrument**: Primary tool for triple transformation
2. **Mediator**: Between Divine consciousness and outer nature
3. **Guide**: Directs the sadhana (practice)
4. **Transforming Agent**: Changes ordinary nature to divine nature
5. **Horizontal Process**: Works from within outward (unlike spiritual descent from above)

**Key Quote**: "The soul and the psychic being are not exactly the same thing, although in essence they are the same. The soul is the divine spark that dwells at the centre of each being... The psychic being is formed progressively around this divine centre... until... it becomes the conscious sheath of the soul"

### How Psychic Development Takes Place :

- Through self-observation
- Aspiration for divine life
- Receptivity to psychic influence
- Active consent and effort
- Gradual growth over many lives (typically)

---

## 8. THE TRIPLE TRANSFORMATION

The Triple Transformation is the core process of Integral Yoga - the transformation of human nature into divine nature :

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     TRIPLE TRANSFORMATION              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. PSYCHIC TRANSFORMATION             │
│     ↓                                  │
│  2. SPIRITUAL TRANSFORMATION           │
│     ↓                                  │
│  3. SUPRAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### First Transformation: Psychic Transformation

**Process**:

- Parts of being (mind, vital, body) open to Psychic Being
- Psychic comes forward from behind the heart
- Outer nature becomes influenced by soul
- Shift of center from ego to psychic

**Characteristics**:

- Psychic being becomes conscious guide
- Harmonization of outer nature
- Inner guidance replaces egoic will
- Preparation for higher transformations

**Result**: "The parts of our being open up and allow the psychic to come forward"

### Second Transformation: Spiritual Transformation

**Process**:

- Descent of higher spiritual consciousness
- Parts of being receive directly from above
- No longer need psychic intermediation
- Influence of Supramental consciousness

**Characteristics**:

- Mother's consciousness-force descends
- Direct action from above
- Nature under Her influence
- Still not fully supramentalized

**Result**: "The parts of our being directly receive from the Supramental consciousness"

### Third Transformation: Supramental Transformation

**Process**:

- Complete change of nature
- Mind loses sense of division
- Acquisition of Supramental knowledge
- Physical body transformed

**Characteristics**:

- Total becomes universal
- Physical transformed into Supramental consciousness
- Body becomes "Sat" (self-conscious being)
- Divine life manifested on earth

**Result**: "Completely changes the nature of mind... The physical is transformed into the Supramental consciousness"

### The Goal: Gnostic Being

- Complete enjoyment and possession of divine nature
- Complete lifting of human nature into divine power
- Integrality essential
- "All Life is Yoga" - every detail of life spiritualized

## 9. INTEGRAL YOGA PRACTICE (SADHANA)

### The Triple Path

Integral Yoga integrates three traditional paths:

| Path                       | Aspect                 | Method                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Jnana Yoga** (Knowledge) | Wisdom, discrimination | Self-inquiry, surrender of ego      |
| **Bhakti Yoga** (Devotion) | Love, devotion         | Surrender to Divine, worship        |
| **Karma Yoga** (Works)     | Action, service        | Selfless action, offering to Divine |

**Integration**: All three practiced simultaneously - knowledge, love, and action united.

### Key Practices:

#### A. Aspiration and Surrender

- **Aspiration**: Yearning for the Divine, for transformation
- **Surrender**: Giving up ego to the Divine Will
- **Receptivity**: Opening to receive higher force

#### B. Rejection and Acceptance

- **Rejection**: Of ego, desire, ignorance, lower nature
- **Acceptance**: Of divine influence, higher consciousness

#### C. Self-Observation

- Witnessing the nature without identification
- Detached awareness of thoughts, feelings, movements
- Essential for psychic development

#### D. Concentration and Meditation

- Focusing consciousness on the Divine
- Ascent to higher levels of mind
- Descent of peace, light, force, ananda

#### E. Invocation of the Mother

- The Mother (Mirra Alfassa) as representative of Divine Consciousness
- "When you call Mother, she does not just come for you alone. She comes for everyone."
- Collective yoga - progress benefits all humanity

### The Process of Sadhana:

**Threefold Method**:

1. **Consecration**: Offering all actions, thoughts, feelings to the Divine
2. **Concentration**: Gathering consciousness toward the Divine
3. **Contemplation**: Dwelling in awareness of the Divine

## 10. COMPARISON WITH WESTERN PSYCHOLOGY

### A. Sri Aurobindo and Carl Jung

**Similarities**:

- Both pioneers of consciousness studies
- Both acknowledged depth and complexity of psyche
- Both recognized multiple levels of consciousness

**Comparisons**:

| Concept         | Sri Aurobindo                        | Carl Jung                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Unconscious** | Subconscious, superconscious         | Personal and collective unconscious |
| **Higher Self** | Psychic Being, Jivatman              | Self (archetype of wholeness)       |
| **Process**     | Triple Transformation                | Individuation                       |
| **Goal**        | Divine life on earth                 | Integration, self-realization       |
| **Evolution**   | Spiritual evolution of consciousness | Psychological development           |

**Jung's Collective Unconscious** ≈ **Aurobindo's Subconscious/Superconscious**

**Individuation** ≈ **Psychic Integration and Transformation**

### B. Comparison with Major Western Approaches

| Aspect            | Integral Yoga               | Psychoanalysis           | Humanistic         | Transpersonal              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **View of Human** | Multi-dimensional being     | Driven by unconscious    | Self-actualizing   | Spiritual being            |
| **Goal**          | Transformation of nature    | Neurosis cure            | Self-actualization | Transcendence              |
| **Method**        | Yoga, meditation, surrender | Analysis, interpretation | Client-centered    | Meditation, altered states |
| **Unconscious**   | Multiple levels             | Repressed material       | Not emphasized     | Higher unconscious         |
| **Spirituality**  | Central                     | Peripheral               | Optional           | Central                    |
| **Evolution**     | Spiritual evolution         | Psychosexual development | Personal growth    | Consciousness evolution    |
| **Body**          | To be transformed           | Analyzed                 | Accepted           | Vehicle for spirit         |

### C. Unique Contributions to Psychology

1. **Evolutionary Perspective**: Consciousness evolves; not static
2. **Triple Transformation**: Systematic map of spiritual development
3. **Psychic Being**: Concept of evolving soul
4. **Integral Approach**: Body, mind, life, spirit as one system
5. **Descent of Force**: Higher consciousness transforming lower nature
6. **Collective Dimension**: Individual progress benefits humanity
7. **Supramental Psychology**: Beyond mind - new principle of consciousness

### D. Integral Yoga as Psychology

Sri Aurobindo explicitly stated: **"Yoga is nothing but practical psychology"**

**Psychological Elements**:

- Systematic self-observation
- Understanding of mental processes
- Transformation of character
- Development of higher faculties
- Integration of personality
