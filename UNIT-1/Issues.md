## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE THREE INTERCONNECTED ISSUES

### Overview

The UGC NET syllabus identifies three critical issues that have plagued Indian psychology throughout its history:

1. **The Colonial Encounter**: How British colonialism shaped the introduction and development of modern psychology in India
2. **Post-colonialism and Psychology**: The ongoing struggle to decolonize psychology and develop authentic Indian approaches
3. **Lack of Distinct Disciplinary Identity**: The crisis of not having a clear, unique identity as a discipline

**Interconnection**: These three issues are deeply intertwined - the colonial encounter created the conditions for post-colonial struggle, which in turn led to the identity crisis.

---

## 2. THE COLONIAL ENCOUNTER

### A. Historical Context

**The Arrival of Modern Psychology**:

- Modern psychology came to India as part of **British colonial education system**
- **No continuity with existing Indian psychological traditions**
- "Western psychology with laboratory work was a novel approach, not having any parallel in traditional Indian psychology"

**The Discontinuity**:

> "During the British rule when modern psychology made a new beginning in India it did not have any continuity with the existing knowledge institutions and field of psychology"

**Indigenous Psychology Ignored**:

- India had sophisticated psychological concepts in Yoga, Vedanta, Buddhism, Ayurveda
- These were not integrated into modern academic psychology
- "Psychology in India did not reap the fruits of this unique advantage"

### B. Characteristics of Colonial Psychology

| Feature               | Description                                        | Impact                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Imitative**         | Copied Western models without critical examination | Lack of originality       |
| **Dependent**         | Relied on Western theories and methods             | Intellectual subservience |
| **Discontinuous**     | No connection with Indian traditions               | Loss of cultural roots    |
| **Elitist**           | Served colonial and elite interests, not masses    | Social irrelevance        |
| **Scientific veneer** | Claimed objectivity and universality               | Masked cultural bias      |

### C. The Colonial Psychology Project

**Girindrasekhar Bose's Resistance** :

- Created **unique amalgam of Advaita Vedanta and psychoanalysis**
- "Resisted this epistemic violence by maintaining local cultural conceptions of the self, the mind and salvation, while incorporating the modern, technical language of psychoanalysis"
- First and longest-running department of psychology in India at University of Calcutta
- President of Indian Psychoanalytical Association

**The Dual Path** :

- **Owen Berkeley-Hill**: British psychoanalyst who gave "positivist Freudian justification to colonialism"
- **Girindrasekhar Bose**: Indian psychoanalyst who developed indigenous theory of "opposite wish"
- "Two different epistemic models: one based on expansion, the other on translation/graft"

### D. Epistemic Violence

**Definition**: The imposition of foreign knowledge systems that delegitimize native ways of knowing

**Manifestations**:

- Indian psychological concepts labeled as "philosophical," "religious," or "unscientific"
- Terms like "rebirth," "transmigration," "supernatural powers" rejected by empirically trained psychologists
- "Considered 'glib talk,' 'revivalism,' 'uncritical worship of the past'"

**Nandy's Analysis** :

> "Colonialism is not only about economic gain and political power but is a state of mind"
> "Second colonization - the colonization of the mind"

---

## 3. POST-COLONIALISM AND PSYCHOLOGY

### A. The Post-colonial Condition

**Definition**: The ongoing struggle to overcome colonial legacies and develop authentic, decolonized approaches

**Key Insight**: Political independence (1947) did not bring psychological independence

> "For Nandy, actual colonialism embarked on after 1947, while the outward reinforce to colonial philosophy ruined and the impedance to it continued"

**The Continuation of Colonial Psychology**:

- Western theories continued to dominate
- Indian psychologists still trained in West
- Research remained imitative
- "Psychology in India is mostly a poor imitation of western research"

### B. Nandy's Post-colonial Critique

**Ashis Nandy - The Pioneer**:

- Clinical psychologist turned political psychologist
- "One of the pioneers of cultural and post-colonial studies in the Subcontinent"
- _The Intimate Enemy: Loss and Recovery of Self Under Colonialism_ (1983) - seminal work

**Key Arguments**:

1. **Psychology of Colonialism** :
   - Colonialism affects both colonizer and colonized
   - "The colonized mind suffers from continuous oppression that estranges the individual from her identity and cultural values"
   - "Hyper-masculine" colonial identity vs. Indian "androgynous" tradition

2. **The Intimate Enemy** :
   - Colonization of the mind is deeper than political colonization
   - "The danger in the experience of colonialism is self-identity"
   - Both cultures (colonizer and colonized) become altered and hybrid

3. **Critique of Modernity** :
   - Modern Indians have "deeply imbibed a Western view of their place in world history"
   - "Notions of nationalism, progress, rationality, secularism... have taken on a Western aura"
   - "Modern Indians have lost their cultural memories, becoming strangers to vital aspects of their own past"

4. **Resistance Through Tradition** :
   - Recovery of Indian tradition as resistance
   - Gandhi as exemplar of "unheroic but critical traditionalism"
   - "Alternative universalism" based on Indian beliefs

### C. The Decolonization Project

**Goals**:

- Legitimizing native, indigenous epistemological and cosmological forms
- "Surmounting the dehumanization inflicted by colonialism through restitution, restoration, and forgiveness"
- Moving beyond "Global North and South" divide

**Challenges** :

- Decolonization encounters resistance
- Need for "open mind beyond the Global North and South"
- Psychologists must contribute to "global decolonial turn"

### D. The Post-colonial Dilemma

**Nandy's Position**:

- Distances himself from Fanon's violent resistance
- Advocates "non-violent obstinacy"
- "Only the weak and meek can spearhead this process"
- "Freedom is indivisible, with both, oppressed and oppressor captured in the webs of oppression"

**The Hybrid Self** :

- Indian self is "neither well-defined nor clear-cut"
- "The other appears 'telescoped' in the very self as part of it"
- "Multiplicity of the self" - capacity to live with ambiguities

---

## 4. LACK OF DISTINCT DISCIPLINARY IDENTITY

### A. The Identity Crisis

**Core Problem**: Indian psychology has struggled to define what it is

**The Three Possible Meanings** :

| Term                    | Definition                                          | Problem                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Psychology in India** | Western psychology practiced in India               | Imitative, not authentic             |
| **Psychology of India** | Study of Indian people using any methods            | May still use Western frameworks     |
| **Indian Psychology**   | Psychology based on Indian philosophical traditions | Is it scientific? Is it nationalist? |

### B. Manifestations of Identity Crisis

**Historical Evolution**:

| Period               | Crisis Manifestation                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-independence** | Western dominance, no Indian voice                       |
| **1947-1970s**       | Expansion without identity; "two worlds" problem         |
| **1970s**            | "What is Indian psychology?" - Nandy's critique          |
| **1980s**            | Indigenization attempts; endogenous vs. exogenous debate |
| **1990s**            | **Paradigmatic concerns, disciplinary identity crisis**  |
| **2000s**            | Emergence of Indian psychology; but issues persist       |

**Key Symptoms** :

1. **Imitative Research**:
   - "Psychology in India is mostly a poor imitation of western research"
   - "Does not lead to understanding Indian social reality"

2. **Lack of Originality**:
   - "Indian psychology has become not merely imitative and subservient but also dull and replicative"
   - "Adoptology" - mere adoption without adaptation

3. **Social Irrelevance**:
   - "Methodologically sophisticated but socially irrelevant research"
   - "Indian psychologists were increasingly marginalized in the society"

4. **Fragmented Efforts**:
   - "Efforts to investigate indigenous concepts and theories were fragmented"
   - "Did not show any long-term research commitment"
   - "Mostly one-time affairs lacking in in-depth analysis"

### C. The "Left Out" Problem

**Marginalization in National Planning**:

> "The feeling of 'left out' has sprouted among psychologists a strong urge to make their research efforts relevant to the process of national development"

**Comparison with Other Social Sciences**:

- Economics, sociology, political science more prominent
- Psychology on the **"backbench"** in national planning
- "Psychologists wanted to break free from theoretical and methodological constraints"

### D. Professional vs. Personal Identity Split

**The "Two Worlds" Phenomenon**:

| Aspect          | Professional World           | Personal World             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Orientation** | Western, scientific          | Indian, cultural           |
| **Values**      | Objectivity, universality    | Subjectivity, context      |
| **Methods**     | Quantitative, experimental   | Qualitative, introspective |
| **Identity**    | Western-trained psychologist | Indian cultural being      |
| **Knowledge**   | Western theories             | Traditional wisdom         |

**Paranjpe's Analysis** :

> "A vast majority of Indian psychologists have shied away from Indian psychological perspectives"
> "Psychologists share the socio-cultural context with the Indian masses, but do not integrate it with their professional identity"

**Consequences** :

- "Split in personality" - psychologist as professional vs. as person
- "Lack of creativity, originality, and burn out"
- "Lack of effort to raise critical issues, engage in movements"

---

## 5. THE "TWO WORLDS" PHENOMENON

### A. Detailed Analysis

**The Split**:
Indian psychologists live in two different worlds simultaneously:

**World 1: Professional (Western)**

- Identification with Western scientific psychology
- Laboratory research, quantification, experimentation
- "Value-free" research
- Publication in Western journals
- Career advancement through Western recognition

**World 2: Personal (Indian)**

- Indian cultural values and traditions
- Concern for social problems
- Spiritual/philosophical orientation
- Personal practice of yoga, meditation
- Connection with Indian masses

### B. Examples of the Split

| Psychologist      | Professional                        | Personal                                                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **N.N. Sengupta** | Experimental psychology (Wundtian)  | Wrote on mysticism and Western dance                            |
| **G.S. Bose**     | Psychoanalysis (Freudian)           | Interpreted Gita; developed Indian theories of unconscious      |
| **B.N. Seal**     | Experimental psychology             | Historian of Indian science; inspired Sinha's Indian psychology |
| **J.B.P. Sinha**  | Organizational psychology (Western) | Nurturant Task Leadership (Indian)                              |

### C. The Cost of the Split

**Individual Level**:

- Cognitive dissonance
- Lack of authenticity
- Professional burnout
- Reduced creativity

**Disciplinary Level**:

- Lack of distinct identity
- Imitative research
- Social irrelevance
- Marginalization

**Societal Level**:

- Psychology not serving Indian society
- Wasted intellectual resources
- Perpetuation of colonial structures

---

## 6. ATTEMPTS AT RESOLUTION

### A. The Indigenization Movement

**Durganand Sinha's Contribution**:

> "Indigenisation is the process of making the discipline sensitive to cultural nuances and social reality"

**Goal**:

> "The goal of indigenization is the development of 'appropriate psychology' and not 'parochial psychology'"

**Two Routes** :

- **Exogenous**: Adapting Western concepts to Indian context
- **Endogenous**: Developing concepts from Indian traditions

### B. The Indian Psychology Movement

**2002 Manifesto**:

- 150+ psychologists gathered in Pondicherry
- Defined Indian psychology as based on Indian traditions
- Not "psychology of Indian people" or "psychology taught in India"

**2008 Handbook**:

- _Handbook of Indian Psychology_ (Rao, Paranjpe, Dalal)
- Established academic legitimacy

### C. Post-colonial Resistance

**Strategies**:

1. **Recovery of tradition**: Reclaiming Yoga, Vedanta, Buddhism
2. **Critical traditionalism**: Selective use of tradition for critique
3. **Hybrid approaches**: Combining Indian and Western
4. **Epistemic resistance**: Challenging Western knowledge claims

### D. Limitations of Resolutions

**Persistent Problems**:

| Issue                       | Manifestation                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conformity**              | "Sticking to the paradigm of being a good scientist"             |
| **Fragmentation**           | "One-time affairs lacking in-depth analysis"                     |
| **Name controversy**        | "'Indian psychology'... needs explanation every time"            |
| **Nationalism association** | "Courts controversy due to associations with Indian nationalism" |
| **Marginalization**         | "Recipient nature of research endeavours"                        |
| **Applied gap**             | "Lack of applied orientation"                                    |

---

## 7. CURRENT STATUS AND ONGOING CHALLENGES

### A. Progress Made

**Academic Legitimacy**:

> "By the turn of this new millennium, the academic scenario is changing in India. The scientific community is better prepared now than in the past to accept a psychology rooted in native wisdom and philosophical texts"

**Institutional Recognition**:

- Courses on Indian psychology at IIT Kanpur and other institutions
- Handbook of Indian Psychology (2008)
- _Foundations and Applications of Indian Psychology_ (2014)
- Integration in some teaching programs

### B. Ongoing Challenges

**The Unfinished Agenda**:

| Challenge                    | Current Status                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Distinct identity**        | Partially resolved; still debated         |
| **Decolonization**           | Ongoing; post-colonial struggle continues |
| **Social relevance**         | Improving; still marginal in policy       |
| **Professional integration** | "Two worlds" problem persists             |
| **Global recognition**       | Growing; but still peripheral             |
| **Applied orientation**      | Still lacking                             |

**Cornelissen's Concern** :

> "Psychologists have been challenged to grapple with the real issues of development and to act as social catalysts in the change process"

**Nandy's Continuing Relevance** :

- Critique of modernity, secularism, state worship still pertinent
- "The Intimate Enemy" remains foundational text for post-colonial psychology
- Call for "critical traditionalism" still resonates

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR EXAM

### Must-Know Points:

1. **Three critical issues are interconnected**: Colonial encounter created conditions for post-colonial struggle, which led to identity crisis

2. **Colonial encounter characteristics**: Discontinuity with Indian traditions, imitative Western psychology, epistemic violence against indigenous knowledge

3. **G.S. Bose's resistance**: Created unique amalgam of Advaita Vedanta and psychoanalysis; maintained local cultural conceptions while using modern technical language

4. **Ashis Nandy's post-colonial critique**: "The Intimate Enemy" (1983); colonialism is "state of mind"; "second colonization" (colonization of mind) continues after 1947; psychology of both colonizer and colonized

5. **"Adoptology"**: K.G. Agrawal's term for Indian psychology as mere adoption without critical examination

6. **Identity crisis manifestations**: "Dull and replicative" (Nandy), lack of originality, social irrelevance, "two worlds" phenomenon, marginalization in national planning

7. **"Two worlds" phenomenon**: Professional Western identity vs. personal Indian identity; split leads to lack of creativity, burnout, social irrelevance

8. **Indigenization as response**: Durganand Sinha's "appropriate psychology"; two routes (endogenous and exogenous); goal is cultural sensitivity, not parochialism

9. **Post-colonial continuity**: Political independence (1947) did not bring psychological independence; Western models continued to dominate; decolonization remains unfinished

10. **Current status**: Some progress with Indian Psychology movement (2002 Manifesto, 2008 Handbook), but challenges persist - "recipient nature of research," "lack of applied orientation," marginalization

11. **Nandy's "critical traditionalism"**: Selective recovery of tradition for post-colonial critique; alternative to both blind modernization and uncritical traditionalism

12. **Epistemic violence**: Imposition of Western knowledge systems that delegitimize native ways; Indian psychological concepts rejected as "philosophical" or "unscientific"

13. **The "left out" problem**: Psychology on "backbench" of national planning; feeling of marginalization; urge to make research relevant

14. **Hybridity**: Both colonizer and colonized become altered; Indian self is "neither well-defined nor clear-cut"; multiplicity and ambiguity

15. **Unfinished agenda**: Psychologists challenged to "grapple with real issues of development" and "act as social catalysts"; decolonization continues
