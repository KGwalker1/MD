## 1. INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Definition

The **Pre-independence era** in Indian psychology refers to the period from the late 19th century to 1947, when modern academic psychology was introduced, established, and developed in India under British colonial rule .

### Historical Timeline Overview:

| Period               | Phase                | Characteristics                                                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ancient-Medieval** | Indigenous Period    | Philosophical, spiritual psychology in texts                                |
| **1757-1857**        | Early Colonial       | British rule begins; Western education introduced                           |
| **1857-1900**        | Foundation Period    | Universities established; psychology part of philosophy                     |
| **1900-1916**        | Pre-institutional    | Syllabi drafted; laboratories planned                                       |
| **1916-1947**        | Institutional Period | Departments established; research begins; professional organizations formed |

### Colonial Context :

- Modern psychology arrived as part of British colonial education system
- No continuity with existing Indian psychological traditions
- Western psychology introduced as "ready-made intellectual package"
- Colonial government more interested in anthropology and sociology for governance than psychology
- Psychology primarily served teacher training needs

---

## 2. INDIGENOUS ROOTS: ANCIENT INDIAN PSYCHOLOGY

### Pre-Colonial Psychological Thought :

Before Western psychology arrived, India had sophisticated psychological concepts embedded in philosophical and spiritual traditions:

**Key Concepts:**

- **Karma**: Actions and their psychological consequences
- **Dharma**: Moral duty and psychological development
- **Moksha**: Spiritual liberation as psychological goal
- **Atma-vichara**: Inner exploration/self-inquiry
- **Atma-jnana**: Self-realization
- **Yoga**: Systematic practices for mind control
- **Meditation**: Techniques for consciousness development

**Sources:**

- **Patanjali's Yoga Sutras**: Systematic psychology of mind
- **Charaka Samhita**: Ayurvedic psychology
- **Upanishads**: Philosophy of consciousness
- **Bhagavad Gita**: Psychology of action and devotion
- **Buddhist texts**: Abhidhamma psychology

**Characteristics of Indigenous Psychology** :

- Integrated with spirituality and religion
- Holistic approach (mind-body-spirit unity)
- Practical and applied orientation
- Problem-solving focus
- Interdisciplinary nature
- Symbiosis between human and nature (not dichotomous as in West)

### Discontinuity :

> "During the British rule when modern psychology made a new beginning in India it did not have any continuity with the existing knowledge institutions and field of psychology. Western psychology with laboratory work was a novel approach, not having any parallel in traditional Indian psychology."

- Replication of Western studies on Indian samples

#### 2. Imitative Nature

- Psychology did not attract "brilliant people" initially
- Focus on "safe" areas (sensation, perception) rather than social issues

#### 6. Beginning of Indigenization (Late Period)

- Seal's work on Indian psychology history
- Gopalswami's test adaptations

#### 7. Applied Psychology Emergence (Late 1930s-40s)
