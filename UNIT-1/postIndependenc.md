## 1. INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

### Definition

The **Post-independence era** in Indian psychology spans from 1947 to the present, characterized by massive expansion, institutional development, crisis of identity, and the ongoing movement toward indigenization and the emergence of Indian psychology .

### Historical Timeline Overview:

| Phase       | Period        | Characteristics                                     |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | 1947-1970s    | Expansion, institutionalization, Western dominance  |
| **Phase 2** | 1970s-1980s   | Crisis of identity, indigenization movement         |
| **Phase 3** | 1990s         | Paradigmatic concerns, disciplinary identity crisis |
| **Phase 4** | 2000s-Present | Emergence of Indian psychology in academia          |

### Key Distinction from Pre-independence:

> "After Independence in 1947 the National Government recognised the importance of social science teaching and research in attaining the objectives of national reconstruction and social development."

Unlike the colonial period, post-independence psychology was expected to contribute to **national development**, **social reconstruction**, and address **Indian social realities** .

## 2. PHASE 1: EXPANSION AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION (1947-1970s)

### A. Massive Expansion of Departments

| Year                | Development                    | Details                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **1947**            | 3 departments at independence  | Calcutta, Mysore, Patna       |
| **1950**            | Department at Pune established | Experimental psychology focus |
| **1956**            | UGC constituted                | Major funding for expansion   |
| **By end of 1960s** | 32 psychology departments      | Across Indian universities    |
| **1970s**           | Continued expansion            | Many new universities added   |

**Growth Pattern**:

- Psychology departments split from Philosophy departments
- Many faculty from philosophy background moved to psychology
- Unplanned expansion without clear specialization strategy
- Departments developed around "personalities" (heads) rather than programs

### B. Funding and Support

**Key Funding Agencies**:

- **University Grants Commission (UGC)**: Established 1956; major grants for teaching and research
- **Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR)**: Research project funding
- **State Governments**: Opened degree and postgraduate colleges
- **Ford Foundation, Fulbright, Commonwealth**: International exchange programs

**Impact**:

- Generous grants led to "boom" in 1950s-1970s
- Large-scale hiring in universities and colleges
- Research publications took "quantum jump"
- However, quality concerns emerged later

### C. Educational Exchange Programs

**Bilateral Academic Exchange Programs**:

- **Commonwealth Fellowships**
- **Fulbright Fellowships**
- **Ford Foundation Fellowships**
- **UGC and Ministry of Education programs**

**Impact**:

- Large number of Indian scholars went to UK, US, Canada for doctoral and post-doctoral training (1960s-1970s)
- Returned with better research training and contemporary ideas
- Continued academic collaboration with foreign professors
- Western scholars visited Indian universities
- **Psychology dominated by scholars trained abroad for two decades**

### D. Research Characteristics (1947-1970s)

**Continued Western Dominance**:

- Most research was "continuation of research conducted during colonial period"
- Replication of Western studies on Indian samples
- "Poor imitation of Western research"
- Laboratory-based experimental work (perception, learning, memory)
- Psychological testing (intelligence, personality)

**Two Major Research Streams**:

1. **Experimental Psychology**:
   - Perception, psychophysics, reaction time
   - Chatterjee (1954): Apparent movement studies
   - Tayal (1970): Challenging Fechner's law
   - J.P. Das (1962): Verbal conditioning, semantic satiation
   - S.D. Singh (1963): Comparative psychology (rhesus monkeys)

2. **Mental Testing**:
   - Indian adaptations of Western tests
   - Spearman, Binet-Simon, Stanford-Binet adaptations
   - Intelligence testing in Indian languages

**Applied Psychology Growth**:

- **Industrial psychology**: Job attitudes, work incentives, absenteeism
- **Motivation research**: McClelland's achievement motivation
- **Counseling and guidance**: Patna model inspired other states

### E. Distinctive Department Identities

| Department    | Specialization              | Key Figure      |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Allahabad** | Rural and Social Psychology | -               |
| **Mysore**    | Test Construction           | M.V. Gopalswami |
| **Osmania**   | Industrial Psychology       | -               |
| **Patna**     | Measurement and Guidance    | H.P. Maiti      |
| **Poona**     | Verbal Learning             | V.K. Kothurkar  |
| **Utkal**     | Centre for Advanced Studies | -               |

**Problem**: When department heads transferred, interest often reduced; centers collapsed or shifted

### F. "Two Worlds" Phenomenon Continued

Indian psychologists continued to live in two worlds:

- **Professional**: Western scientific psychology, value-free research
- **Personal**: Indian cultural values, philosophical traditions

**Manifestations**:

- Faculty from philosophy background dissociated from parent discipline
- Fascination with "value-free" experimental work
- Interest in memory, psychophysics, perception (culturally neutral)
- Little integration of Indian philosophical knowledge
- "Psychology in India did not reap the fruits of this unique advantage"

---

## 3. PHASE 2: CRISIS AND INDIGENIZATION (1970s-1980s)

### A. The Crisis of Identity (Mid-1970s)

**Growing Disillusionment**:

- Western psychology failing to explain Indian social issues
- "Sixty years of Western psychology in India had not yielded any significant discoveries"
- Methodologically sophisticated but socially irrelevant research
- Indian psychologists increasingly marginalized in society

**Key Critiques**:

| Critic                  | Statement                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ashis Nandy (1974)**  | "Indian psychology has become not merely imitative and subservient but also dull and replicative" |
| **K.G. Agrawal (1973)** | Called Indian psychology "adoptology"                                                             |
| **D. Sinha (1977)**     | Called for indigenous psychology with own paradigms                                               |

**Core Problem**: Failure to resolve inner conflicts between cherishing Indian cultural values personally and maintaining Western orientation professionally

### B. The Move to Addressing Social Issues (1970s)

**Shift in Focus**:

- Psychologists began engaging in **socially relevant research**
- Addressing **national reconstruction** and **social development**
- Moving beyond "safe" laboratory topics to real-life problems

**Key Social Issues Addressed**:

| Issue                 | Research/Action                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Communal violence** | Gardner Murphy's UNESCO project (1950); "In the Minds of Men" (1953) |
| **Partition trauma**  | Studies on Hindu-Muslim riots, refugee rehabilitation                |
| **Poverty**           | Studies on deprivation, disadvantage                                 |
| **Education**         | National integration, educational psychology                         |
| **Caste attitudes**   | Adinarayan (1953, 1958), Rath & Sircar (1960), Anant (1970)          |
| **Rural development** | Allahabad school focus                                               |

**Example - Prasad's Rumor Study (1935)**:

- Content analysis of rumors during Bihar earthquake
- Found anxiety-inducing rumors justified fear
- **Inspired Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory**

### C. The Indigenization Movement (1980s)

**Key Developments**:

- Recognition that Western theories don't fit Indian reality
- Need for psychology rooted in Indian cultural context
- Search for identity and distinctiveness

**Jadunath Sinha's Early Work**:

- Wrote on Indian psychology (1958)
- Rejected by empirically trained psychologists
- Considered "glib talk," "revivalism," "uncritical worship of the past"
- Terms like "rebirth," "transmigration," "supernatural powers" seen as unscientific

**Durganand Sinha's Contribution** :

- "One of the architects of modern Indian psychology"
- Emphasized sociocultural context in cognitive development
- Argued Western models must adapt to India's cultural realities
- Proposed "nurturant task leadership" (J.B.P. Sinha 1980)
- Concepts: "extension motivation," "dependency proneness," "achievement value"

**Challenges to Indigenization**:

- Resistance from Western-trained psychologists
- Lack of criticality about Indian culture itself
- Search for homogenizing universal applications
- Sometimes claims of cultural superiority over Western models

---

## 4. PHASE 3: PARADIGMATIC CONCERNS (1990s)

### A. Disciplinary Identity Crisis

**Key Issues**:

- What constitutes "Indian psychology"?
- Is it psychology in India, psychology of India, or Indian psychology?
- Methodological tensions: Western scientific vs. indigenous approaches
- Professional vs. personal identity splits

**Paranjpe's Analysis**:

- "A vast majority of Indian psychologists have shied away from Indian psychological perspectives"
- Psychologists share socio-cultural context with Indian masses but don't integrate it professionally
- Creates "split in personality" - psychologist as professional vs. as person
- Contributes to lack of creativity, originality, and "burn out"

### B. Research Outside Universities

**Shift to Research Institutes**:

- Difficult to conduct research in bureaucratic university setup
- Campus unrest, heavy teaching loads, no research incentives
- Psychologists preferred research institutes over universities

**Major Research Institutes**:

| Institute                                   | Location  | Focus                     |

6. **Brain Drain**: Bright students leaving for UK, US, Canada

7. **Employment Issues**: Teaching absorbs maximum graduates; limited applied opportunities until recently

8. **Resistance to Indigenization**: Western-trained psychologists rejecting Indian perspectives as "revivalism"

9. **Lack of Criticality**: Sometimes uncritical acceptance of Indian traditions

10. **Paradigmatic Crisis**: Identity crisis - what is Indian psychology?

### Recent Positive Developments:

- Growing job opportunities in applied fields
- Armed forces as major employer
